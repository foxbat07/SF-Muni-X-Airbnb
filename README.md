# SF-Muni-X-Airbnb
Correlating SF transit data with Airbnb postings. 
Welcome to the SF-Muni-X-Airbnb wiki! The goal of this prototype is to visualize Muni routes & correlate it with Airbnb locations in San Francisco. My hypothesis is that availability of public transport affects Airbnb locations & prices.

The SF Muni locations are updated every 15 seconds. The blue triangles are oriented to show the direction in which the muni is heading. Additional muni details can be obtained on mouseover.
The routes & stops are mapped out based on the data and official color of the route.
The Airbnb locations are represented as orange points. In future work the colors can represent price, distance from muni stop, convenience etc.
Neighbor and street details are revealed on mouseover.

Buttons:
Muni Location: Toggle to visualize current Muni locations (blue triangles)
Airbnb Location: Toggle to visualize Airbnb locations (orange circles)
Route Stops: Toggle to visualize stops of selected Muni (color rings)
Route Path: Toggle to visualize route path (color from muni path)
Selected Routes: Dropdown checkbox to select a subset of routes.
